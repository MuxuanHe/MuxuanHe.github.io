I'm a fourth-year PhD student in linguistics at the University of Southern California.

My research interests are primarily in phonology, morphology, and experimental/lab phonology. I'm advised by [Stephanie Shih](https://stephsus.github.io/) and [Louis Goldstein](https://sail.usc.edu/~lgoldste/me/), and I'm especially interested in the relationship between the phonological grammar and the lexicon. Much of my research focuses on the phonological and lexical representations of morphologically complex words. I've worked extensively on the phonology of affixed words, and have most recently concentrated my work on phonological exceptionality and its association with particular affixes. 

Before starting at USC, I received a BA and MA from Michigan State University. For my MA, I studied phonotactic acceptability judgments using experimental methods from speech perception and was advised by [Karthik Durvasula](https://karthikdurvasula.gitlab.io/).
