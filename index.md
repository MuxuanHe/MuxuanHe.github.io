Hi! I'm Muxuan, a fourth-year PhD student in linguistics at the University of Southern California.

As a psycholinguist, I study how comprehenders/listeners perceive and process information received, espeically at the **pragmatics** level. Some of the questions that leads to include whether different kinds of information treated equally and what do comprehenders actually gain from the information received. In my research, I work with **behavioral** data that uncovers real-time sentence processing and off-line sentence **comprehension** that probes pragmatic inferences. A key aspect of my work also involves **computational** methods, such as probalistic modeling, to make explicit predictions about recursive reasoning in communication.

I also have started to work on phonetics (both learning and doing research), particularly devoted to my beloved and unstudied dialect, <i>Wuxue</i> Mandarin.
